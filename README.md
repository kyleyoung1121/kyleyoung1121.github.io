# ui-proj1-smartbike

Hello and welcome to my User Interface project 1
This is my Smart Bike application

To run the code, do the following:
Create and enter a new directory on your PC
Clone this repo into the directory
Enter the ui-proj1-smartbike folder
> npm install
> npm run dev
After launching the app, you can follow the consoles instructions to find the localhost page that the app is running in

Please note that upon downloading this project to a separate device, my third phone screen was having issues getting all images to load.
You can press on the different buttons to turn on and off the music, headlights, and to accelerate the bike
Accelerating on the bike will simulate the map moving, and will show several displays updating with new information.
